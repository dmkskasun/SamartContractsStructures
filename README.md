### How to find errors and how to solve them?

![Supply Image](Images/one.gif)

The above Gif Image shows once you compile the above simple, smart contract, you get errors in lines 7 and 8. Line 7 says 

#### " Did you intend to add "public" ? function get() 

This means we need to add "public." or if it is private we can add "private" after the get().

But its still give an error on line 8.
